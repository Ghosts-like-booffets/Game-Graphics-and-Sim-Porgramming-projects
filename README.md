# Game-Graphics-and-Sim-Porgramming-projects
Code from projects developed during my Associates program for Game Graphics and Simulation Programming at TSTC

Each script and folder is an assignment or piece of a project from my courses throughout the Gaming Graphics and Sim Programming major at TSTC, each one has to do with a different aspect of game design or mechanics, (graphics rendering through opengl, actual control script for players, levels, and npcs, as well as basic frameworks for mechanics such as quest logs, objective completion, and dialogue.  
Also included is the first version of my final project, Cube Crush, as rudimentary arena Hack n Slash with basic implementation of action focused combat, enemy health and ai, and score counting.
